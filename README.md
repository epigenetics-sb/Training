# Workshop: Bioinformatic Processing of DNA Methylation Data

**Location:** Saarbrücken and online (hybrid)

## Overview
This workshop aims to convey fundamental knowledge on the bioinformatic processing of DNA methylation data. We will explore the biological relevance of DNA methylation and review major methodologies for its measurement, with a particular focus on methylation arrays.

Participants will learn how to access publicly available methylation datasets and how to set up a reproducible analysis environment using **RStudio** and **RnBeads**. The course covers the complete workflow for array-based DNA methylation analysis, from data import to quality control, normalization, and downstream analysis.

Comprehensive methylation profiles will be generated, followed by exploratory and comparative analyses to identify methylation differences across biological sites, cell types, and pathological conditions, with a focus on **neurodegenerative diseases**. Advanced topics such as reference-based deconvolution will be introduced to disentangle cell-type- and disease-specific methylation signals.

Participants will also gain the skills needed to apply these methods to their own array-based methylation data after the workshop.
